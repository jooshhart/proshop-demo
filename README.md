# Overview

My goal is to demonstrate my abilities of creating an application that can interact with user and its information to be changed by the users except some information only available to the admins.

I created an ecommerce site called proshop that is supposed to interact with users that want to buy electronics.

I created this site to test my abilities with MERN Stacking.

# Development Environment

The different tools I used were MongoDB Compass, and Postman in order to test backend connections with the client.

I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with different programs like Mongoose, Express, React, and Node.js in order to create the site.

# Future Work

- Add in a Profile Screen
- Add in admin priviledges to change info through the site
- Apply the build for using the site for any user
